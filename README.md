After over three years of working as a lawyer and academic assistant in the field of intellectual property law and new technologies, I've decided to "switch sides" and explore the programming world as a software developer. So far I've learned HTML, CSS, Ruby and the basics of Rails, and I have a strong desire to learn more tools and technologies in order to broaden my skillset.

As a future software developer, I would like to find myself in a position where I could work with a group of passionate people who like sharing knowledge and enjoy improving the results of their works.

##### Attention to detail

Working as a IP/IT lawyer vastly improved my ability to process huge amount of details and new informations in a very short time. I've learned to make sure that all facts relevant to a client were considered and properly elaborated upon. It helps me a lot with programming as I'm well aware that each sentence should be given a thought as even a smallest slip may have ... consequences.

##### Agile working

Some of my offices' clients used to work in Agile what required from me - as a person drafting their software development and maintenance contracts - deep understanding of this methodology. I believe that my knowledge and experience in this field will help me smoothly enter the programming workflow.

##### Research

I have almost 4 years experience as an academic researcher and lecturer. I used to work as a head of research project on international copyright law at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, collaborating with UC Berkeley and Max Planck University. I've received £ 35 000 state grant for my research and soon will be defending my PhD thesis (I've already received positive review, at the moment I'm scheduling the defence).

##### Friendly team-player

I'm a very sociable person, truly enjoying teamwork, always willing to discuss, collaborate and improve. I consider myself empathic, what helps me successfully working with (almost*) everyone.

(* just a tiny disclaimer - lawyer's habit...)
