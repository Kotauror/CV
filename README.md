<p> After over three years of working as a lawyer and academic assistant in the field of intellectual property law and new technologies, I've finally decided to "switch sides" and enter the programming world as a software developer. I'm passionate about coding and it's practical implementations - from solving complicated logical problems to building fun games and pleasing graphical designs.

Check out my <a href="https://justyna-zygmunt.surge.sh">portfolio</a> to learn more about my various projects.

#### Front-end and Design

I pay a lot of attention to UI/UX, my projects look and feel pleasing. I'm fluent in CSS and HTML, working well with JavaScript and its libraries. Check out my favourite designs: <a href="http://news-summaries.surge.sh/">News Summaries App</a> in JS, <a href="http://bombercat.surge.sh/">Bombercat Game</a> in JS & CreateJS, and <a href="http://amarchitektura.surge.sh">Architecture Portfolio</a> in pure CSS & HTML (done before Makers Academy).

#### Back-end

I feel comfortable in the back-end, solving logical problems gives me lots of fun and satisfaction. I have experience in Rails - see my <a href="http://photo-fridge.herokuapp.com">Instagram Clone</a> and <a href="http://london-dinosaurs.herokuapp.com">Dinosaur app </a>(done before Makers Academy), pure Ruby and SQL - see my <a href="http://tweet-chit.herokuapp.com/">Twitter clone</a> - and worked a bit with NodeJS: <a href="https://github.com/tamasmagyarhunor88/makersBNB"> AirBnB clone</a>.

#### Testing

I use TDD - most of my projects have test coverage of over 95%. I've worked with RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Mocha and Zombie. I've also worked on building a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/moisty">simple testing framework</a> at Makers Academy.

#### Attention to detail

Working as a IP/IT lawyer vastly improved my ability to quickly process huge amounts of detail. I've learned to make sure that all the facts relevant to the client were considered and properly elaborated upon. It helps me a lot with programming as I'm well aware that each sentence should be given a thought as even a smallest slip may have adverse consequences.

#### Research

I'm an experienced researcher with patience to find answers to all relevant questions. I used to work on a government-funded grant and carry out research tasks at UC Berkeley and Max Planck Institute.

#### Agile working

Some of my previous offices' clients used to work in Agile what required from me - as a person drafting their software development and maintenance contracts - a deep understanding of this methodology. I believe that my knowledge and experience in this field will help me smoothly enter this programming workflow.

#### Friendly team-player
I'm a very sociable person, truly enjoying teamwork, always willing to discuss, collaborate and improve. I consider myself empathic, which helps me successfully work in a team environment.
